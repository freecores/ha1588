General Description

Hardware Assisted IEEE 1588 IP Core. The necessary FPGA logic to assist SW protocol stack in implementing the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588-2008) on 1000M/100M/10M Ethernet networks. PTP packet transmitting and receiving is implemented with any existing MAC inside or outside the FPAG; The IP Core will implement the tunable Real-Time Clock and Time Stamping of PTP event packets (L2, UDP/IPv4/MPLS/VLAN and UDP/IPv6/MPLS/VLAN) in two-step-mode.

Feature Description

RTC: Real Time Clock.
 * Standard PTP clock output with 2^48s and 2^32ns time resolution.
 * Tunable accumulator based clock with 2^-8ns time resolution and 2^-32ns period resolution.
 ** Direct ToD write, with 2^-8ns resolution.
 ** Direct frequency write, with 2^-32ns resolution.
 ** Timed temporary time adjustment, with 2^-8ns resolution and 2^32bit timer.
 * Clock Domain Crossing hand-shaking, for SW read and write accesses.
 
TSU: Time Stamping Unit.
 * Two-Step PTP operation.
 * 15-entry timestamp queue. 
 * 128bit timestamp format.
 ** 16bit extra information.
 ** 80bit timestamp.
 ** 32bit packet identity data.
 * GMII interface tap with line-speed PTP event packet parsing.
 ** Sync
 ** Delay_Req
 ** Pdelay_Req
 ** Pdelay_Resp
 * Variety of PTP packet formats support.
 ** L2 PTP packet with stacked VLAN tags.
 ** IPv4 and IPv6 UDP PTP packet with stacked VLAN tags and stacked MPLS labels.
 * 32bit internal datapath for easier timing closure.

SystemVerilog DPI based simulation environment is included for SW driver development.

The IP Core can be used as an IP Component in Altera SOPC Builder.

The only FPGA vendor dependent module is the timestamp queue. This Altera DCFIFO can be replaced by other FPGA vendor specific dual clock FIFO.
